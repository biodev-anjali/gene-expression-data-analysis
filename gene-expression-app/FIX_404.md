# Fix 404 Error on Vercel

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Verify Root Directory in Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **General**
4. Scroll to **Root Directory**
5. Make sure it's set to: `gene-expression-app`
6. If it's blank or wrong, change it and **Save**
7. Go to **Deployments** and trigger a new deployment

### Step 2: Check Build Logs
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to **Deployments**
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Check **Build Logs** for errors
4. Common issues:
   - Missing `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
   - Prisma migration errors
   - Build command failures

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables
1. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Make sure `DATABASE_URL` is set
3. Make sure it's enabled for **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development**
4. If missing, add it and redeploy

### Step 4: Simplify Build (if migrations failing)
If build is failing on migrations, we can make it more resilient.

Option A: Update build command to skip migrations if they fail
Option B: Create migration first, then deploy

## Most Common Cause

**Root Directory not set correctly** - This is the #1 cause of 404 errors.

Make sure in Vercel Settings → General → Root Directory is set to: `gene-expression-app`
